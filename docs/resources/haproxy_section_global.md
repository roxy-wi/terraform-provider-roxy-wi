## Import

In Terraform v1.7.0 and later, use an import block to import Group. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = roxywi_haproxy_section_global.example
  id = "1-global"
}
```

Using terraform import, import Group can be imported using the `id`, e.g. For example:

```shell
% terraform import roxywi_haproxy_section_global.example 1-global
```
