# roxywi_user_role (Data Source)

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->

The users can be granted different permissions for managing server groups. A set of permissions and privileges available for a user is called role. Each user can be assigned one of the following 4 roles:

- `guest` is just a visitor of Roxy-WI website and does not have the right to perform any operations;
- `editor` can edit configuration files and restart HAProxy and Nginx services;
- `admin` can also manage groups allowed by the SuperAdmin but has no access to the Admin Area;
- `superAdmin` manages everything at global level and has the ability to add, edit and remove servers; add users and assign roles to them; to edit all configs and changes all settings

## Example Usage

provider "roxywi" {
  base_url = "https://..."
