# Roxy-WI Provider Examples

This directory contains a set of examples of using various Roxy-WI services with
Terraform. The examples each have their own README containing more details
on what the example does.

To run any example, clone the repository and run `terraform apply` within
the example's own directory.

For example:

```console
% git clone https://github.com/roxy-wi/terraform-provider-roxy-wi.git
% cd terraform-provider-aws/examples/group
% terraform apply
...
```
